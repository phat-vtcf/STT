# Ben and Gaofei's STT Branch

Welcome to our branch, where we walk you through running inference on an English STT model!

## Instructions for use

In the root directory (above) you should find a file called `run_inference_test.ipynb`. Click on that file, and then click "run in colab". The instructions will take you through the whole process.

Enjoy!
